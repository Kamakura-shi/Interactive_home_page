I decided to create a homepage with my knowledge acquired in React. A simple homepage built with HTML and styled with CSS is what we could call static. This same homepage can be made fully dynamic with the framework we call React, the interactive behavior is possible with the help of the programming language named Javascript. In this projet, I used a superset of that same language named Typescript.

I combined this interative aspect of React with a styling library named Tailwind. I did not need a web designer to make the icons in this website, all was done automatically with the help of lucide-react.
Below is a preview of how this project comes all together:
